## 📂 Project Structure

```
visited-places/
│
├── index.html
├── style.css

```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User clicks **"Add New Place"**
2. A pop-up form appears
3. User enters details
4. JS dynamically creates a card
5. On reload, saved data is re-rendered


Example structure:

```js
[
  {
    name: "Nairobi National Park",
    location: "Kenya",
    date: "2025-01-12"
  }
]
```
